# rarsaScripts

This is a collection of scripts that I have created to help me with my day to day usage of linux.

I learned something new when I wrote each of them. From the most simple scripts to those a bit more complex. In fact, sometimes the one liners were the harder to write.

My goal is to create code that is clean, follows standards and is easy to understand. If you see me breaking any of those goals, please let me know.
