These are the things I'd like to do in the order I think I'll implement them:

- Loop every x minutes with the selected option
- Create an UI to select the parameters
- Read parameters from configuration file
- Accept wildcards for files
- Collage mode: receives a parameter with the number of files to use for the collage
