These are the things I'd like to do in the order I think I'll implement them:

- Expand a random single image from the selected directory
- Pass list of files to assign to monitors
- Repeat files if directory has less images than the number of monitors
- Loop every x minutes with the selected option
- Create an UI to select the parameters
- Read parameters from configuration file
- Accept wildcards
